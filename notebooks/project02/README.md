# Project 2 — Titanic Dataset Features

## Objective
To learn how to build predictive machine learning models using the Titanic dataset.

---

## Introduction
In this project, we use the Titanic dataset — a pre-loaded dataset containing demographic and survival information for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.  
It includes features such as passenger class, sex, age, fare, and survival status.

This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to:
- Practice handling missing data  
- Explore relationships between features  
- Engineer new variables  
- Build and evaluate predictive models  

We aim to understand how these features may have influenced the survival outcomes of Titanic passengers.

## Steps Involved

### Section 1: Import the Data
1. Import necessary libraries  
2. Load the Titanic dataset  
3. Display basic dataset information  
4. Check for missing values and summary statistics  
5. Examine correlations among features  

---

### Section 2: Data Exploration and Preparation
1. Explore data patterns and distributions  
2. Handle missing values and clean the data  
3. Perform feature engineering  

---

### Section 3: Feature Selection and Justification
1. Choose key input features and the target variable  
2. Define **X** (features) and **y** (target)  

---

### Section 4: Splitting the Data
1. Perform a basic train/test split  
2. Perform a stratified train/test split  
3. Compare the results from both methods
