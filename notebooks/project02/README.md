 Project 2
# Titanic Dataset Features

## Objective: To learn how to build predictive machine learning models by using the Titanic dataset.


## Introduction: In this project we use Titanic dataset which is a pre-loaded dataset that contains demographic and survival information for the passengers of the RMS Titanic. It includes features like passenger class, sex, age, fare and survival status. This dataset is a great beginner's step to learn how to build predictive models for machine learning projects. In this example, we will explore how these features from this dataset possibly influenced survival outcomes of the passengers in the RMS Titanic. 

## Steps Involved
- 1. Import the data
- 1.1 Import the libraries
- 1.2 Load titanic dataset
- 1.3 Display basic info about data
- 1.4 Checking for missing values and summary statistics
- 1.5 Check for correlations
