# Project 3 — Building a Classifier using Titanic Dataset

## Objective
To use the titanic dataset to build and evaluate three classifiers: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Neural Netowrk to compare model performance on predicting passenter survival.

## Introduction


In this project, we use Titanic dataset which is a pre-loaded dataset that contains demographic and survival information for the passengers of the RMS Titanic. It includes features like passenger class, sex, age, fare and survival status. We use this titanic dataset to build and evaluate three classifier models: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Neural Network to compare model performance on their effectiveness for predicting passenger survival. 

## Steps Involved

### Section 1: Import the Data
1. Import necessary libraries  
2. Load the Titanic dataset  
3. Display basic dataset information  
4. Check for missing values and summary statistics  
5. Examine correlations among features

### Section 2: Data Exploration and Preparation
1. Explore data patterns and distributions  
2. Handle missing values and clean the data  
3. Perform feature engineering  

---

### Section 3: Feature Selection and Justification
1. Choose key input features and the target variable  
2. Define **X** (features) and **y** (target)  

---

### Section 4: Splitting the Data
1. Perform a basic train/test split  
2. Perform a stratified train/test split  
3. Compare the results from both methods
